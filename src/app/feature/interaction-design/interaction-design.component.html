    "Empowering Engaging Digital Experiences: The Art of Interaction Design"
  </p>
  <p>
    Interaction design (IxDF) focuses on creating engaging interfaces for
    digital platforms. Designers craft meaningful interactions between users and
    systems, considering user behaviour, psychology, and interface
    functionality. IxDF designs intuitive user interfaces (UIs) for websites,
    mobile apps, and software applications.
